Some 3D models developed over the course of my PhD at Edinburgh

- A Opentrons OT-2 robot tip for on-the-well electroporation. It can hold two aluminium electrodes on the end and it has holes to add a banana plug cable receiver. Then it can be connected to a BioRad electroproration source using a banana plug cable. The size was conceived for 48-well plates.
